This project will eventually be a small application that takes a string
of numbers and returns a sorted list of numbers.

The list-operations file defines two sorting functions--least-sort and 
greatest-sort--that take a list and return sorted lists from least to 
greatest and greatest to least-respectively. 

The string-operations file defines functions that transforms a string of
number characters to a list of strings and then a list of numbers.  The list 
of numbers are then passed into the functions define in the list-operations 
file.
